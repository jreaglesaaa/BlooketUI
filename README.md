# BlooketUI
This is a script which creates a sleek UI, which allows you to use Blooket hacks easily.

This project took a while to make, so please star it.

#### If you find any issues or have a suggestion open a issue [here](https://github.com/ZasticBradyn/BlooketUI/issues/new/choose)
### This project is still in developement therefore all the hacks arent added yet, be patient.

## Supported Gamemodes:
- Tower Defense
- Gold Quest
- Racing
- Crazy Kingdom
- Fishing Frenzy
- Tower of Doom
- Global

## Issues
### Im currently aware of the following issues and im working to fix them:
- The debugger doesnt seem to be detecting your name correctly
- When you press the X button the console gets spammed with errors (we cant really fix this unless you guys dont want it to re-detect the gamemode)

## How to use the Blooket UI
First, copy the script in the `Script.js` file.
Go onto Blooket and type `javascript:` into the address bar and then paste the script (CTRL + V).
press enter
and then Select the hack you want to use from the hack window!
