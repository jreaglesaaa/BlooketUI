# BlooketCheat UI
This is a script which creates a sleek UI, which allows you to use Blooket hacks easily.

### This project is still in developement therefore all the hacks arent added yet, be patient.
#### If the hacks break open an [issue](https://github.com/ZasticBradyn/BlooketUI/issues/new/choose)

## How to use the Blooket UI
First, copy the script in the `Script.js` file.
Go onto Blooket and type in `javascript:` into the adress bar.
Select the hack you want to use from the hack window!
